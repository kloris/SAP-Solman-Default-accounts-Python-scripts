Python scripts to exploit SAP Default accounts in SAP solution Manager

Within the SAP solution Manager some accounts exist with default passwords. For details see https://protect4s.com/erp-sec-releases-free-tooling-check-sap-platform-default-solution-manager-users/

These Python scripts can be used to exploit users with these default accounts.

Please make sure to use a SAP RFC SDK (Can be downloaded from the SAP marketplace) as a SAP customer or get one elsewhere).
